In the spring of 2021, a Five-Panel Initiation Crown (2018.112) (Fig. 1), believed to date to the 18th century, was brought to the Sculpture and Decorative Arts Conservation Lab at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA) for examination and treatment prior to display. The crown entered the VMFAâ€™s collection in 2018 as part of a large bequest from the estate of Dr. Mary Shepherd Slusser, a preeminent Western scholar of Himalayan art with a research focus on Nepalese material culture. During her time in Nepal, she acquired a large collection of paintings, works on paper, and three-dimensional objects, but unfortunately among the records accompanying the bequest, there was no information on where or when she purchased this particular object.
